```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

Q26. What is a string? How can we declare string in Python?
Ans-String is a series of character in python. 
    strings in python are declared by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.
    A='Ramesh'
    B="Suresh"
    print(A)


Q27. How can we access the string using its index?
Ans-Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.

    However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.

    Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.


Q28. Write a code to get the desired output of the following
```
string = "Big Data iNeuron"
desired_output = "iNeuron"

Ans-string='Big Data iNeuron'
    print("desired output=",string[-1:-1])


Q31. How can you delete entire string at once?
Ans- A='Suresh'   #Assigning a string to a variable
     del A        #Deleting a astring with del
     print(A)     #If we print then result will not display

Q32. What is escape sequence?
Ans An escape sequence is a sequence of characters that, when used inside a character or string, does not represent itself but is converted into another character or series of characters. 
    An escape character is a backslash \ followed by the character you want to insert.

Q33. How can you print the below string?
```
'iNeuron's Big Data Course'
```

Ans- 'iNeuron's Big Data Course'
     Print("iNeuron's Big Data Course")

Q34. What is a list in Python?

Ans Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

    Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Q35. How can you create a list in Python?

Ans- Lists are created using square brackets:

     Example- A=["apple,"orange","mango"]
              print(A)


Q36. How can we access the elements in a list?

Ans-List items are indexed and you can access them by referring to the index number

``` 
Ans-


Q38. Take a list as an input from the user and find the length of the list.

Ans-list=input("Enter a list:")
    print(len(list))

Q39. Add the word "Big" in the 3rd index of the given list.
```
lst = ["Welcome", "to", "Data", "course"]

Ans  lst.insert(2,"Big")
```  print(lst)

Q40. What is a tuple? How is it different from list?

Ans- Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
     Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.


Q41. How can you create a tuple in Python?

Ans- Tuples are written with round brackets.

     To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.

Q42. Create a tuple and try to add your name in the tuple. Are you able to do it? Support your answer with reason.

Ans- Since tuples are immutable, they do not have a build-in append() method, but there are other ways to add items to a tuple.
    
    1. Convert into a list: Just like the workaround for changing a tuple, you can convert it into a list, add your item(s), and convert it back into a tuple.
       
      Example- thistuple("suresh","naresh","Ramesh")
               y=list(thistuple)
               y.append("Trinath")
               thistuple=tuple(y)
               print(thistuple)
    2. Add tuple to a tuple. It is allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:
       
      Example- thistuple("suresh","naresh","Ramesh")
               y=("Trinath",)
               thistuple+=y
               print(thistuple)

Q43. Can two tuple be appended. If yes, write a code for it. If not, why?
Ans- yes, Add tuple to a tuple. It is allowed to add tuples to tuples, so if you want to add one item, (or many), create a new tuple with the item(s), and add it to the existing tuple:
       
      Example- thistuple("suresh","naresh","Ramesh")
               y=("Trinath",)
               thistuple+=y
               print(thistuple)

Q44. Take a tuple as an input and print the count of elements in it.
Ans- y=(1,2,3,1,2,3,1,2,2)
     print(y.count(1))
     

Q45. What are sets in Python?

Ans-Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
    A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.

Q46. How can you create a set?

Ans-Sets are created with using curly brackets{}.

Q47. Create a set and add "iNeuron" in your set.

Ans-thisset={"neuron","pneuron"}
    thisset.add("inueron")
    print(thisset)

Q48. Try to add multiple values using add() function.

Ans-thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
    tropical = {"pineapple", "mango", "papaya"}

    thisset.update(tropical)

    print(thisset)

Q49. How is update() different from add()?

Ans-add() is intended for a single element , while . update() is for the introduction of other sets.

Q50. What is clear() in sets?

Ans-The clear() method empties the set

Q51. What is frozen set?

Ans-Frozen set is just an immutable version of a Python set object. 

Q52. How is frozen set different from set?

aAns-While elements of a set can be modified at any time, elements of the frozen set remain the same after creation. 

Q53. What is union() in sets? Explain via code.

Ans-The union() method returns a set that contains all items from the original set, and all items from the specified set(s). 

    Example-set_a = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
            set_b = {3,6,8,9,10}

            print(set_a | set_b)

Q54. What is intersection() in sets? Explain via code.

Ans-The intersection() method returns a set that contains the similarity between two or more sets. 

    Example-set_a = {1,2,3,4,5,6}
            set_b = {3,6,8,9,10}

            print(set_a & set_b)

Q55. What is dictionary ibn Python?

Ans-Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
    
   
Q56. How is dictionary different from all other data structures.

Ans- A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.


Q57. How can we delare a dictionary in Python?

Ans-Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values{key:values}

Q58. What will the output of the following?
```

```

Ans-<class 'dict'>

Q59. How can we add an element in a dictionary?

Ans-Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it


Q60. Create a dictionary and access all the values in that dictionary.

Ans- thisdict = {"brand": "Ford","model": "Mustang","year": 1964}

     x = thisdict.values()

     print(x)

Ans- myfamily = {
  "child1" : {
    "name" : "Emil",
    "year" : 2004
  },
  "child2" : {
    "name" : "Tobias",
    "year" : 2007
  },
  "child3" : {
    "name" : "Linus",
    "year" : 2011
  }
}

  print(myfamily)

Q62. What is the use of get() function?

Ans-The get() method returns the value of the item with the specified key.
